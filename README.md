## Expectations
The followings are what our module needs to be able to do.
- [x] Cubic transition among story groups.
- [x] Pause the story immediately when the users rest and hold, continue when lifted.
- [x] Go to the previous story and/or story group when users tapped left.
- [x] Go to the next story and/or story group when users tapped right.
- [x] Story media could be dummy images and videos on the internet to be downloaded by the player.
- [x] Duration for images is 5 seconds.
- [x] Durations for videos are their content length.
- [x] Each story in a story group should have an individual progress bar on top of the screen which arranges itself according to its duration.
- [x] While users swiping among story groups, story groups should start from the story they left off unless they are seeing for the first time.
- [x] Usage of bloc architecture is a must. (I used GetX as the mail I recieved advised to do so)
- [x] Source code should be uploaded to GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitlab or else.

When a user has been clicked, their stories are started to being viewed. On the top of the screen, the remaining viewing time takes places.

As it can be seen from this image, the transition between users are in a rectangular format, just like the actual Instagram!

Last of all, notice that after all of the stories of a user has been viewed, the circle behind their profile picture becomes grey.
